    <h2>Server</h2>
    <p>
        A server is a piece of computer hardware or software (computer program) that provides functionality for <br>
        other programs or devices, called “clients”. This architecture is called the client–server model1. Strictly speaking, the term server refers to a computer program or process (running program). Through metonymy, it refers to a device used for (or a device dedicated to) running one or several server programs. On a network, such a device is called a host
    </p>
    <h2>Clent</h2>
    <p>
        The term "client" has multiple meanings, but in the context of computing, it refers to a piece of software or hardware that requests a service from a server. The server is often located on another computer system, in which case the client accesses the service by way of a network.
